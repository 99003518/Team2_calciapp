#### TEST PLAN (FACTORIAL)
| ID |Description | Expected input or state | Expected output or State |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|T_01_LL_06_HL_02 |Check whether the input is less than 0 |N= -3 |Error message 
|T_02_ LL_06_HL_02 |Check whether the input is 0| N= 0 |1 
|T_03_ LL_06_HL_02 |Check whether the input is 1 |N=1 |1 
|T_04_ LL_06_HL_02 |Check whether the input is greater than 0| N= 8 |40,320
#### Test Plan (nPr and nCr)
Test Plan for nPr and nCr operations As per formula we know the calculations for both nPr and nCr operations include factorial operation Here we listed some factorials, nPr and nCr calculations

  LL_05 TEST PLAN 

| TEST\_ID | DESCRIPTION | EXPECTED INPUT | EXPECTED OUTPUT |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T\_01\_LL\_05\_HL\_02 | To check the output when the exponent is positive | Numbers x and y greater than one | Output is greater than one |
| T\_02\_LL\_05\_HL\_02 | To check the output when the exponent is negative | Number x is greater than zero and y is less than zero | Output is less than one |
| T\_03\_LL\_05\_HL\_02 | To check the output when the exponent is zero | Number x is greater than zero and y is equal to zero | Output is equal to one |
