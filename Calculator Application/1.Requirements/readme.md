BRIEF HISTORY OF A CALCULATOR

People's best friend has always been, and will always be, calculator. This powerful yet diminutive device has undergone a few significant facelifts over the millennia but their basic functions would be familiar in concept to our ancestors.
In the very beginning the abacus was introduced .It is a sort of hand operated mechanical calculator using beads on rods, first used by Sumerians and Egyptians around 2000 B C.The abacus was a table of successive columns with beads or stones representing a single unit, which could be used for addition or subtraction. Fast forward 4,500 years to 1617, when Scottish mathematician John Napier published Radiology or “calculation with rods.” In 1642, the first true “calculator” was invented: one that performed calculations through a clockwork-type of mechanism. The Pascal calculator, invented by French inventor and mathematician Blaise Pascal, was lauded for attempting arithmetic calculations previously thought impossible.
Curt Herzstark invented the first handheld, mechanical calculator in 1945 from a design he had created in 1938.In 1948 the pocket-sized calculator was invented and came in the form of the Curta calculator.The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970.In 1990 TI-81 the first graphics calculator developed for math education that added a new visual dimension to mathematics instruction. 
In the mid-2000s many of the modern smart phones were introduced and with them came a new way of calculation. Modern scientific calculators are used nowadays for all the purpose. Calculators are now in every phone, every tablet, and in every app store from 1$ to 600$.

1. PRODUCT DEFINATION
   (SOLID STATE CALCULATOR)

1(A). OLD FEATURES OF THE DEVICE:
	-An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

	-The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was 	developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas).
 
	-Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of 		integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

	-Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital 		assistant (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices.

	-In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations. 		Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra. Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional Euclidean space. As of 2016, 	basic 	calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.

	-In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information. By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%
